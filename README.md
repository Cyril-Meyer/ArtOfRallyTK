### Acknowledgement

I would never have embarked on the mod creation project for this game if
it was not as interesting.
Thanks to [funselektor](https://funselektor.com/) for their great game.

Thanks a lot to [Thea Sch√∂bl](https://github.com/Theaninova) for her help and
work around the Art of Rally modding community.

Thanks to [Dacarpe03](https://github.com/Dacarpe03) for his
[ArtOfRallyAI](https://github.com/Dacarpe03/ArtOfRallyAI) project, who made
me want to get into the modding 'game'. (to beat him by doing better of course)
